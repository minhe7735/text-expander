# ZMK Text Expander: Type Less, Say More!

![zmkiscool](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bacdf566-406d-4f88-afa0-e91c9ae1f414)

## What is This?

The ZMK Text Expander is a powerful feature for your ZMK-powered keyboard. It lets you type a short abbreviation (like "eml"), and have it automatically turn into a longer phrase (like "my.long.email.address@example.com"). It's perfect for things you type often!

## Cool Things It Can Do

* **Your Own Shortcuts:** Create your own personal list of short codes and what they expand into.
* **Fast & Smart:** Uses a speedy lookup method (a trie) to find your expansions quickly.
* **Works Smoothly:** Typing out your long text happens in the background, so your keyboard stays responsive.
* **Flexible Trigger Behavior:** Set a global default for whether to "replay" the trigger key (like spacebar), and override it for specific expansions.
* **Easy Setup:** Add your expansions directly in your keyboard's configuration files.
* **Full Unicode Support:** Easily define expansions with any Unicode character, like `λ`, `€`, or `°`.
* **Locale Support:** Works with non-US layouts (French AZERTY, German QWERTZ) so your expansions type correctly on any machine.

## How to Use It (The Basics)

1.  **Type Your Short Code:** As you type letters (a-z) and numbers (0-9), the text expander remembers them.
    * For example, if you have a shortcut "brb" -> "be right back", you'd type `b`, then `r`, then `b`.
2.  **Trigger the Expansion:** Press a key you've configured to trigger expansions. This can be a dedicated manual trigger key or an automatic trigger key like `Space` or `Enter`.
3.  **Magic!**
    * If the text expander recognizes your short code, its behavior will change depending on how you've defined the expansion. It operates in two modes: **Text Replacement** or **Text Completion**.
    * **Text Replacement Mode:** This is the default behavior. If your `expanded-text` does **not** start with your `short-code`, the module will:
        1.  Automatically "backspace" to delete the short code you typed (and the trigger character).
        2.  Type out the full `expanded-text`.
        3.  Replay the trigger key you pressed (e.g., it will type a `space` if you triggered with the spacebar), unless configured otherwise.
        * *Example:* An expansion like `sig` -> `- Kindly, Me` triggered with the `spacebar` will delete ` sig ` and type ` - Kindly, Me `.
    * **Text Completion Mode:** This behavior is triggered automatically if your `expanded-text` **does** start with your `short-code`. In this case, the module will:
        1.  Type out only the *rest* of the `expanded-text` immediately after what you typed.
        2.  Replay the trigger key you pressed, unless configured otherwise.
        * *Example:* An expansion like `wip` -> `wip project` triggered with the `spacebar` will keep `wip` on your screen and type ` project ` right after it.
    * If the module doesn't recognize the short code, the trigger key will behave as it normally does.
4.  **Clearing Your Typed Short Code:**
    * Pressing a non-alphanumeric key that is *not* an auto-expand trigger will clear the current short code buffer.
    * `Backspace` will delete the last character you typed into your short code.
    * You can configure specific `ignore-keycodes` (like Shift or Arrows) that allow you to navigate or modify your typing without breaking the expansion sequence.

## Setting Up Your Expansions

The main way to add your text expansions is through your ZMK keymap file (often ending in `.keymap`).

### Special Characters, Newlines, and Unicode

You can easily include special characters in your expansions.

* **For Newlines (Enter) or Tabs:** Use `\n` for Enter and `\t` for Tab. For a literal backslash or quote, use `\\` and `\"`.
* **For Unicode Characters (e.g., λ, €, °):** You have two simple options:
    1.  **Type it directly (Recommended):** Just place the character directly in your `expanded-text`. The build system will automatically handle it.
        * `expanded-text = "The letter is λ."`
    2.  **Use the command format:** You can also use the `{{u:XXXX}}` format, where `XXXX` is the hex code for the character. This is useful for characters that are hard to type.
        * `expanded_text = "The price is {{u:20ac}}100."`
* **Important: Setting the OS for Unicode:** To type Unicode characters correctly, you must tell the engine which operating system you are using (as they all have different input methods). Use a `{{cmd:win}}`, `{{cmd:mac}}`, or `{{cmd:linux}}` command at the beginning of your expansion.

**Important Note on Special Characters in `expanded-text` (DTS Configuration)**

When defining `expanded-text` in your Device Tree files (e.g., `.keymap`), you might encounter build errors during the CMake configuration stage if you are using certain escape sequences like `\n` (for newline/Enter), `\t` (for Tab), `\"` (for a literal double quote), or `\\` (for a literal backslash). These errors often originate from Zephyr's internal `dts.cmake` script and its handling of string properties containing such characters.

To reliably use these special characters in `expanded-text` defined via Device Tree, your Zephyr environment needs to include fixes for these underlying build system issues. You have the following options:

1.  **Use a Patched Zephyr Tree:** Point your ZMK firmware's Zephyr dependency to the `text-expander` branch of this Zephyr fork: `https://github.com/minhe7735/zephyr/tree/text-expander`. This branch is understood to contain the necessary patches. You would typically adjust your `west.yml` manifest file in your ZMK configuration to point to this Zephyr source.

2.  **Use a ZMK Branch with Patched Zephyr:** Point your ZMK firmware to the `text-expander` branch of this ZMK fork: `https://github.com/minhe7735/zmk/tree/text-expander`. This ZMK branch likely manages its Zephyr dependency to include the required fixes. Again, this would involve updating your `west.yml` manifest.

The underlying Zephyr fixes that address these `dts.cmake` parsing issues correspond to commits `c82799b` and `6edefd8` in the main `zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr` repository. Credit for submitting these commits to the Zephyr project goes to Joel Spadin ([https://github.com/joelspadin](https://github.com/joelspadin)).

Once your Zephyr environment includes these fixes (by using one of the options above or by ensuring your Zephyr version incorporates these commits):

### Example: Adding Expansions in Your Keymap

```dts
// You must include the ZMK keys header at the top of your .keymap file
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/keys.h>

/ {
    behaviors {
        txt_exp: text_expander {
            compatible = "zmk,behavior-text-expander";

            // --- OPTIONAL TOP-LEVEL SETTINGS ---
            auto-expand-keycodes = <SPACE ENTER TAB>;
            undo-keycodes = <BSPC>;
            reset-keycodes = <ESC>;
            ignore-keycodes = <LSHIFT RSHIFT LEFT RIGHT UP DOWN>; // Don't reset buffer on these keys
            disable-preserve-trigger; // Global default: DON'T replay the trigger key

            // --- EXPANSION DEFINITIONS ---
            expansion_email: my_email {
                short-code = "eml";
                expanded-text = "my.personal.email@example.com";
                preserve-trigger; // OVERRIDE global default for this one
            };

            expansion_signature: my_signature {
                short-code = "sig";
                expanded-text = "- Jane Doe\nSent from my custom keyboard";
            };

            expansion_lambda: my_lambda {
                short-code = "lambda";
                // You can type 'λ' directly! The build system handles it.
                // We also include the OS command so it types correctly on macOS.
                expanded-text = "{{cmd:mac}}The letter is λ.";
            };
        };
    };

    keymap {
        default_layer {
            bindings = <
                &kp A  &kp B  &txt_exp  &kp D
            >;
        };
    };
};
````

**Important:**

  * `short-code`: Keep these to lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and basic symbols like `[`, `]`, `-`, `=`, `;`, `'`, `,`, `.`, `/`.
  * The `&txt_exp` in your `keymap` should match the name you gave your text expander setup (e.g., `txt_exp` in `&txt_exp` corresponds to `txt_exp: text_expander`).

## Fine-Tuning (Optional Kconfig Settings)

You can fine-tune the text expander's behavior by adding the following options to your `config/<your_keyboard_name>.conf` file. You must first enable the module with `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER=y`.

  * **`CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_HOST_LAYOUT`**: Selects the keyboard layout that matches your host operating system's input language settings. This ensures the module sends the correct keycodes for your language (e.g., typing 'a' correctly on a French AZERTY keyboard).
      * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_LAYOUT_US=y` (Default)
      * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_LAYOUT_FRENCH=y` (AZERTY)
      * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_LAYOUT_GERMAN=y` (QWERTZ)
  * **`CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_DEFAULT_OS_...`**: Sets the default operating system for Unicode input. You can set one of these to `y` in your `.conf` file. They are mutually exclusive with a priority of Linux \> macOS \> Windows. For example, if you set both the Linux and macOS options to `y`, the Linux option will be used. If none are set, the default is Windows.
      * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_DEFAULT_OS_LINUX=y`
      * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_DEFAULT_OS_MACOS=y`
      * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_DEFAULT_OS_WINDOWS=y`
  * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_TYPING_DELAY`: The delay in milliseconds between each typed character during expansion (Default: 10). Note that the engine adds a small random jitter to this delay to simulate natural typing.
  * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE`: Sets the size of the internal buffer for key events (Default: 16). If you are a very fast typist and see `"Failed to queue key event"` warnings in the logs, you may need to increase this value.
  * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_AGGRESSIVE_RESET_MODE`: If enabled, the current short code is reset immediately if it doesn't match a valid prefix of any stored expansion. This gives you instant feedback on typos.
  * `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_RESTART_AFTER_RESET_WITH_TRIGGER_CHAR`: Used with the aggressive mode. If the short code is reset, the character that caused the reset will automatically start a new short code. Without this, the invalid character is simply consumed.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Problem:** Build fails with errors related to escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\\`) in `expanded-text`.

**Solution:** Your Zephyr environment needs patches for Device Tree string parsing. Use one of these options:
1. Use the patched Zephyr branch: `https://github.com/minhe7735/zephyr/tree/text-expander`
2. Use the patched ZMK branch: `https://github.com/minhe7735/zmk/tree/text-expander`
3. Ensure your Zephyr version includes commits `c82799b` and `6edefd8`

**Problem:** `Failed to queue key event` warnings in logs.

**Solution:** Increase the event queue size:
```
CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE=32
```

### Expansion Issues

**Problem:** Expansions don't trigger or type incorrect characters.

**Solution:**
- Verify your `auto-expand-keycodes` include the trigger keys (e.g., `<SPACE ENTER TAB>`)
- Check that your host layout matches: set `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_LAYOUT_US`, `_FRENCH`, or `_GERMAN`
- Enable debug logging to see what's happening:
  ```
  CONFIG_LOG_MODE_MINIMAL=n
  CONFIG_TEXT_EXPANDER_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y
  ```

**Problem:** Unicode characters don't work or appear as question marks.

**Solution:**
- Add the OS command at the start of your expansion: `{{cmd:win}}`, `{{cmd:mac}}`, or `{{cmd:linux}}`
- Or set a default OS in your `.conf` file:
  ```
  CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_DEFAULT_OS_LINUX=y
  ```
- Verify your OS has the correct Unicode input method enabled (Alt+numpad for Windows, Opt+hex for macOS, Ctrl+Shift+U for Linux)

### Performance Tuning

**Problem:** Typing feels too slow or too fast.

**Solution:** Adjust the typing delay (default is 10ms):
```
CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_TYPING_DELAY=15  # Slower
CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_TYPING_DELAY=5   # Faster
```

**Problem:** Undo doesn't work as expected.

**Solution:**
- Verify `undo-keycodes` is defined in your behavior (e.g., `undo-keycodes = <BSPC>;`)
- Undo only works immediately after an expansion completes
- Check logs to see if undo state is being saved correctly

### Debugging Tips

To enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```conf
# In your .conf file
CONFIG_LOG_MODE_MINIMAL=n
CONFIG_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=4096

# Enable debug logging for specific modules
CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y
CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=4
```

View logs using your keyboard's console output method (usually via USB serial connection).

## Getting it into Your ZMK Build

1.  Make sure this text expander module is in your ZMK firmware's build (e.g., in a `modules/behaviors` directory in your ZMK config).
2.  Enable it in your Kconfig file: `CONFIG_ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER=y`.
